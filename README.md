# Simon Game 🎮 | JavaScript Project

An interactive **Simon Game** developed using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on strengthening JavaScript fundamentals through logic-driven UI interactions.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

The Simon Game challenges players to remember and repeat an increasing sequence of colors.  
With every level, the sequence grows — testing memory and attention.

This project helped me practice writing clean JavaScript logic without relying on frameworks or libraries.

## 🔧 Key Concepts Covered

- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript event listeners
- Game logic & state handling
- Arrays for sequence tracking
- Timers and delays using `setTimeout`
- User interaction feedback (animations & flashes)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure
- **CSS3** – styling & animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – game logic

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This project is part of my journey to:
- Build strong **JavaScript fundamentals**
- Prepare for **full-stack (MERN) development**
- Create interactive, logic-based web applications

Alongside this, I actively work on **Data Science and EDA projects**, aiming to combine analytical thinking with real-world application development.
